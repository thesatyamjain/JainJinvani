## 2024-05-23 - Debouncing Search Overlay Queries
**Learning:** In the `SearchOverlay` component, filtering content directly on every keystroke (`query`) blocks the main thread because the calculation of `categoryCounts` and `filteredItems` are synchronous and depend directly on the query state. This leads to input lag and UI stuttering on low-end devices.
**Action:** Debounced the search `query` value and replaced instances of `query` in heavy operations (like `categoryCounts`, `filteredItems` and complex UI logic) with `debouncedQuery`. This allows the input state to update instantly while deferring expensive operations to slightly later, making the UI feel smoother.
## 2026-10-21 - Expensive O(N) calls on React Tabs
**Learning:** The application's search component re-ran the full O(N) ranking algorithm on every category tab switch, instead of just filtering the pre-ranked list, resulting in dropped frames on mobile.
**Action/Prevention:** When a search UI includes sub-filters, always memoize the expensive global ranking computation once per query, and derive the filtered sub-lists and aggregate counts from that cached result.
